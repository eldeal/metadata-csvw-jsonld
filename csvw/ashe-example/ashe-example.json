The CV is the ratio of the standard error of an estimate to the estimate itself and is expressed as a percentage. The smaller the coefficient of variation the greater the accuracy of the estimate. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV. For example, for an estimate of £200 with a CV of 5%, we would expect the true population average to be within the range £180 to £220.",
